HelperFunctions_ReubenPython2and3

Various Python functions that "help" in my larger classes. Many of these functions appear in my other repositories,
and I'm slowly updating those repositories to call these "helper" files so that it's easier to keep all repositories
synchronized with the same helper-function-code (instead of duplicating the same code in each class).

"HelperFunctions_ClassFunctions_ReubenPython2and3.py" contains functions
that can be called from within a custom class (and passed a "self" argument).

"HelperFunctions_NonClassFunctions_ReubenPython2and3.py" contains functions that
can be called outside of a class (and passed a "globals()" global variables argument)
